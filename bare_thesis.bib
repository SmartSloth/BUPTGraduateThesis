  abstract = {This whitepaper proposes OpenFlow: a way for researchers to run experimental protocols in the networks they use every day. OpenFlow is based on an Ethernet switch, with an internal flow-table, and a standardized interface to add and remove flow entries. Our goal is to encourage networking vendors to add OpenFlow to their switch products for deployment in college campus backbones and wiring closets. We believe that OpenFlow is a pragmatic compromise: on one hand, it allows researchers to run experiments on heterogeneous switches in a uniform way at line-rate and with high port-density; while on the other hand, vendors do not need to expose the internal workings of their switches. In addition to allowing researchers to evaluate their ideas in real-world traffic settings, OpenFlow could serve as a useful campus component in proposed large-scale testbeds like GENI. Two buildings at Stanford University will soon run OpenFlow networks, using commercial Ethernet switches and routers. We will work to encourage deployment at other schools; and We encourage you to consider deploying OpenFlow in your university network too},

  abstract = {We report on experiences with Swift congestion control in Google datacenters. Swift targets an end-to-end delay by using AIMD control, with pacing under extreme congestion. With accurate RTT measurement and care in reasoning about delay targets, we find this design is a foundation for excellent performance when network distances are well-known. Importantly, its simplicity helps us to meet operational challenges. Delay is easy to decompose into fabric and host components to separate concerns, and effortless to deploy and maintain as a congestion signal while the datacenter evolves. In large-scale testbed experiments, Swift delivers a tail latency of &lt;50μs for short RPCs, with near-zero packet drops, while sustaining ~100Gbps throughput per server. This is a tail of &lt;3x the minimal latency at a load close to 100%. In production use in many different clusters, Swift achieves consistently low tail completion times for short RPCs, while providing high throughput for long RPCs. It has loss rates that are at least 10x lower than a DCTCP protocol, and handles O(10k) incasts that sharply degrade with DCTCP.},

From years of experience operating large-scale and high-speed RDMA networks, we find the existing high-speed CC schemes have inherent limitations for reaching these goals. In this paper, we present HPCC (High Precision Congestion Control), a new high-speed CC mechanism which achieves the three goals simultaneously. HPCC leverages in-network telemetry (INT) to obtain precise link load information and controls traffic precisely. By addressing challenges such as delayed INT information during congestion and overreac-tion to INT information, HPCC can quickly converge to utilize free bandwidth while avoiding congestion, and can maintain near-zero in-network queues for ultra-low latency. HPCC is also fair and easy to deploy in hardware. We implement HPCC with commodity programmable NICs and switches. In our evaluation, compared to DCQCN and TIMELY, HPCC shortens flow completion times by up to 95%, causing little congestion even under large-scale incasts.},

  abstract = {P4 is a high-level language for programming protocol-independent packet processors. P4 works in conjunction with SDN control protocols like OpenFlow. In its current form, OpenFlow explicitly specifies protocol headers on which it operates. This set has grown from 12 to 41 fields in a few years, increasing the complexity of the specification while still not providing the flexibility to add new headers. In this paper we propose P4 as a strawman proposal for how OpenFlow should evolve in the future. We have three goals: (1) Reconfigurability in the field: Programmers should be able to change the way switches process packets once they are deployed. (2) Protocol independence: Switches should not be tied to any specific network protocols. (3) Target independence: Programmers should be able to describe packet-processing functionality independently of the specifics of the underlying hardware. As an example, we describe how to use P4 to configure a switch to add a new hierarchical label.},
